# BERT-Based Model Implementation and Fine-Tuning

## Introduction
This report details the implementation and fine-tuning of a BERT-based model for generating trade recommendations. The objective was to develop a model capable of processing trade and market data to generate actionable Buy, Sell, and Hold signals. The implementation leverages PyTorch and various machine learning techniques to achieve optimal performance.


## Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset xnas-itch-20230703.tbbo.csv was loaded and processed to extract relevant features. Data normalization and handling of missing values were performed to ensure consistency.

## BERT Model
A BERT model architecture was implemented using PyTorch. The model consists of an encoder structure adapted to handle time-series data and generate trade signals. The encoder processes the input sequences (market data) and generates the output sequences (trade recommendations).

## Fine-Tuning Process
Training Setup
The model was trained on the provided dataset, with the target being the generation of Buy, Sell, and Hold signals. A loss function suitable for classification tasks (Cross-Entropy Loss) was used.



## Evaluation

The generated signals were evaluated against a simple trading blotter. The blotter simulated trades based on the Buy, Sell, and Hold signals, and key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated.


## Results

The final BERT model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test set in generating trade signals. Performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall) indicated the model's ability to provide meaningful trade recommendations.

## Examples of Generated Recommendations

The model provided various trade signals, such as:

Buy: When market conditions indicated an upward trend.
Sell: When indicators showed a potential decline.
Hold: During periods of uncertainty or stable market conditions.

## Conclusion
The implementation and fine-tuning of the BERT-based model demonstrated the model's capability to process market data and generate actionable trade recommendations. The integration of a simple trading strategy highlighted the practical applicability of the model in real-world scenarios.
